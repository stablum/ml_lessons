topics to explore
-----------------

[X] gaussian distribution - importance in nature and why in machine learning
[X] marginal gaussian distribution
[ ] logistic regression and how it relates to linear regression
[ ] calculation of the maximum probability value in a gaussian
[X] bias and variance in machine learning
[ ] generative process vs model
[ ] more samples -> more accurate model
[ ] difference mean mode median
[ ] modal income vs median income
[ ] central limit theorem
[ ] more data -> model parameter that's nearer to the one of the generative process
[ ] example of 1d generative process of gaussian and difference between generative process and model as the sample size gets larger

technicalities
[ ] make github repo
[ ] Assignment:
	[ ] part 1: make a sampling algorithm from a bowl of marbles that have different colors and different counts
	[ ] part 2: explain why you can write a sampling algorithm without the need of normalization (sum to 1)
	[ ] part 3: apply this to a discretization of the domain of a normal distribution to have an approximation of the sampling to a normal distribution
