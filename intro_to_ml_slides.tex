% Frame: What is Machine Learning?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What is Machine Learning?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data
    \item Instead of explicitly programming every rule, we let the computer find patterns
    \item The computer "learns" from examples and improves over time
    \item It's a part of artificial intelligence focusing on data-driven learning
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  Think of it this way: We don't teach a child to recognize cats by giving them precise measurements of whiskers and ear shapes. We show them many examples of cats until they learn the pattern.

% Frame: Why Machine Learning Matters
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Why Machine Learning Matters}
  ML is transforming our world by:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automating complex tasks (like image recognition, translation)
    \item Finding insights in massive datasets too large for humans to analyze
    \item Making predictions about future events (weather, stock prices, customer behavior)
    \item Personalizing experiences (recommendations, search results)
    \item Enabling new technologies (self-driving cars, virtual assistants)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Everyday Examples
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Machine Learning in Your Everyday Life}
  You already interact with ML systems daily:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Email spam filters
    \item Social media feeds and recommendations
    \item Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
    \item Navigation apps predicting traffic
    \item Photo tagging and face recognition
    \item Streaming services suggesting what to watch next
    \item Autocorrect and predictive text
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Main Types of Machine Learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Main Types of Machine Learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supervised Learning}: Training with labeled examples
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Like a student learning with answer keys
        \item Examples: spam detection, house price prediction
      \end{itemize}
      
    \item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning}: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Like grouping similar items without being told how
        \item Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection
      \end{itemize}
      
    \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}: Learning through trial and error
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Like training a dog with treats for good behavior
        \item Examples: game playing, robotics, self-driving cars
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Supervised Learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning: Learning with Examples}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We provide the algorithm with labeled training data
    \item The algorithm learns to map inputs to correct outputs
    \item Once trained, it can make predictions on new data
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Two main types:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classification}: Predicting categories (spam/not spam, dog/cat/bird)
    \item \textbf{Regression}: Predicting numerical values (house prices, temperature)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Example: Teaching a computer to recognize handwritten digits by showing it thousands of images labeled with the correct number.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Unsupervised Learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We provide data without labels or "correct answers"
    \item The algorithm discovers structure, patterns, or relationships
    \item Useful when we don't know what patterns to look for
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Common applications:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clustering}: Grouping similar items (customer segments, similar documents)
    \item \textbf{Dimensionality Reduction}: Simplifying data while preserving important patterns
    \item \textbf{Anomaly Detection}: Finding unusual data points (fraud detection)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior without predefined categories.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Reinforcement Learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Doing}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An agent learns by interacting with an environment
    \item Actions that lead to rewards are reinforced
    \item The agent learns optimal behavior through trial and error
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Key concepts:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker
    \item \textbf{Environment}: What the agent interacts with
    \item \textbf{Actions}: What the agent can do
    \item \textbf{Rewards}: Feedback on how good an action was
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  Example: An AI learning to play chess by playing thousands of games and learning which moves lead to winning.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: The Machine Learning Process
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The Machine Learning Process}
  A typical ML project involves these steps:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define the problem}: What are you trying to predict or understand?
    \item \textbf{Collect data}: Gather relevant information
    \item \textbf{Prepare data}: Clean, organize, and format for learning
    \item \textbf{Choose a model}: Select an algorithm appropriate for your problem
    \item \textbf{Train the model}: Let it learn from the training data
    \item \textbf{Evaluate performance}: Test how well it works on new data
    \item \textbf{Tune and improve}: Refine to get better results
    \item \textbf{Deploy and monitor}: Use in the real world and keep watching
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Data is King
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Data is King}
  The success of machine learning heavily depends on data:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quantity}: Generally, more data leads to better models
    \item \textbf{Quality}: Clean, accurate data is essential
    \item \textbf{Relevance}: Data must relate to what you're trying to predict
    \item \textbf{Diversity}: Data should represent all scenarios the model will face
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  
  Remember: "Garbage in, garbage out" - even the best algorithms will fail with poor data.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Frame: Model Evaluation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{How Do We Know If It's Working?}
  Evaluating model performance:

    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: Percentage of correct predictions (for classification)
    \item \textbf{Precision and Recall}: Balance between false positives and false negatives
    \item \textbf{Mean Squared Error}: Average squared difference between predictions and actual values (for regression)
    \item \textbf{Confusion Matrix}: Detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions
  \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  
  Always test on data the model hasn't seen during training to ensure it can generalize.
